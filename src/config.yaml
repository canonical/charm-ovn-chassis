    description: >
      A space-delimited list of key-value pairs that map a network interface
      MAC address to a local ovs bridge to which it should be connected.

      Bridges referenced here must be mentioned in the `ovn-bridge-mappings`
      configuration option.

      If a match is found the bridge will be created if it does not already
      exist, the matched interface will be added to it and the mapping found in
      `ovn-bridge-mappings` will be added to the local OVSDB under the
      `external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings` key in the Open_vSwitch table.

      An example value mapping two network interface mac address to two ovs
      bridges would be:

          00:00:5e:00:00:42:br-internet 00:00:5e:00:00:51:br-provider

      NOTE: We explicitly do not allow blanket configuration through the use
      of interface names here.  This is due to the fact that with OVN you get a
      fully distributed network without the need for external networking
      connected to every chassis in the network, and we want to break the habit
      of doing so by requiring a well-informed configuration.
  ovn-bridge-mappings:
    type: string
    default:
    description: >
      A space-delimited list of key-value pairs that map a physical network
      name to a local ovs bridge that provides connectivity to that network.

      The physical network name can be referenced when the administrator
      programs the OVN logical flows either by talking directly to the
      Northbound database or by interfacing with a Cloud Management System
      (CMS).

      Each charm unit will evaluate each key-value pair and determine if the
      configuration is relevant for the host it is running on based on matches
      found in the `interface-bridge-mappings` configuration option.

      If a match is found the bridge will be created if it does not already
      exist, the matched interface will be added to it and the mapping will be
      added to the local OVSDB under the `external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings` key
      in the Open_vSwitch table.

      An example value mapping two physical network names to two ovs bridges
      would be:

          physnet1:br-internet physnet2:br-provider

      NOTE: Values in this configuration option will only have effect for units
      that have a interface referenced in the `interface-bridge-mappings`
      configuration option.
